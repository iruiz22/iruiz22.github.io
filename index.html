        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>Hello! My name is Isabella Ruiz and I am a junior at Stanford University, majoring in Human Biology and minoring in Art Practice. My dream is to become a <a href="https://ami.org/medical-illustration/enter-the-profession/careers">medical illustrator</a>, and this year (2020), I have had lots of opportunities to build up my portfolio. Here is a collection of my sketches, finished graphite/charcoal pieces, and finished acrylic pieces I have made during this year. Unfortunately, not everything is anatomical. I do have to practice the basics before I can devote myself completely to the human body and all of its secrets. I suppose still lives are my vegetables and they should be eaten before dessert! My journey is far from over and I am far from perfect! But, I love drawing and I love anatomy, so while my journey will be long, it will be very fun. The human body is so fascinating and I can't wait to draw or paint everything about it! </p>
        <p><i>Trigger/Content warning: Some of my sketches (on the sketches page) are of nude models and feature depictions of breasts, buttocks, and male/female genitalia. However, everything I have drawn has been purely to capture the human form.</i></p>
